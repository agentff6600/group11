##Installing Grunt
To install Grunt, you must first download and install node.js (which includes npm). npm stands for node packaged modules and is a way to manage development dependencies through node.js.

Then, from the command line:
Install `grunt-cli` globally with `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
Navigate to the root /bootstrap/ directory, then run `npm install`. npm will look at the package.json file and automatically install the necessary local dependencies listed there.
When completed, you'll be able to run the various Grunt commands provided from the command line.
